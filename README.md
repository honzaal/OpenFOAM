# VIV_cylinder (not ready for use)

Vortex induced vibrations tutorial case, the starting point for the first "discord-project". Dynamic mesh with SDOF & transient BC, setup suitable for OpenFOAM 5.0. This case is based on wingMotion tutorial (pimpleDyMFoam) with some changes applied. The setting has some flaws, check later for updates.

# VIV_cylinder_v2

The same case with different settings, much quicker results. Steady-state simulation with mapping added so the show starts quickly (good for testing), but for real I'd use only the unsteady part with transient BC.
