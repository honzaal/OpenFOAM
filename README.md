Vortex induced vibrations tutorial case, the starting point for the first "discord-project". Dynamic mesh with SDOF & transient BC, setup suitable for OpenFOAM 5.0. This case is based on wingMotion tutorial (pimpleDyMFoam) with some changes applied. The setup has been validated - but only with a very crude experiment. There might be some minor flaws, so check for updates.
